Snake


Code for the game Snake should be written.  You should move the snake in 4 directions using cursor keys on the keyboard. Building blocks of the snake itself should be made of empty space (spacebar-FFFFh), so that the empty space is colored in a different color from the background one. Food for the snake is randomly generated in random locations also in empty spaces colored in a different color than the background and the snake. 
Starting position of the snake is in the middle of the playground and the length of the snake is 4 blocks. Game stops when something of the following happens: ESC key is pressed, there is a collision with an obstacle or collision of the snake with itself. After the game ends, total number of points is displayed on the screen.
While starting and after ending the game, the program should enter a main menu state in which there will be choice of either entering a new game, exiting the program, or choosing the speed of the snake.
